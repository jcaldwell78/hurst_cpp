 <h3>
 Basic Statistics Functions
 </h3>

 <p>
 This <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> generated C++
 documentation was created for a set of basic statistics functions.
 These basic statistics functions have been described in many books
 and web pages.  My objective was not to restate this material yet
 again, but to summarize some of the basic equations and provide C++
 software that implements these functions.  My <a
 href="http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/wavelets/stat/index.html">Basic
 Statistics</a> web page provides the equations and some references.
